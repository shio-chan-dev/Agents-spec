# Org Chart

Current structure (expand as needed):

- human/gong (Owner)
  - ai/tech-lead/rep-01 (Tech Lead / DRI)
    - ai/backend/rep-01 (Backend Rep)
    - ai/frontend/rep-01 (Frontend Rep)
  - ai/agent-orchestrator/01 (Agent Orchestrator / Cross-team)

Notes:
- Keep agent IDs stable; if a role is handed over, reuse the same ID.
- Add new departments under the tech lead or split by domain.
- Historical roles with migrated logs:
  - ai/doc/01 (agents/ai/doc/01/log.md)
- Raw backup of the original work log remains in coordination/work_log_legacy.md.
